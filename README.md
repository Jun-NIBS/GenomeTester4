FastGT is implemented as a sub-project of GenomeTester4, sharing some source files.  
Source files are inside the GenomeTester4 distribution.  
FastGT has two binaries - gmer_counter and gmer_caller.  

Building FastGT binaries:  
Change into subdirectory 'src\' and type:  
```
make gmer_counter
make gmer_caller
```
* k-mer lists and user manual for FastGT are available from http://bioinfo.ut.ee/FastGT/
